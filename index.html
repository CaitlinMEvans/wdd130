            Hi, my name is Caitlin Evans, and I am a student at BYUi for Software Engineering. 
            I am taking WDD 130, learning about web development as part of my BS for Software Engineering! 
            I am excited to build and design websites though I have been doing it already for many years. 
            For whatever reason my intro classes did not transfer well for credits while the high levels did, so I am retaking some fundemental classes I have already completed previously. More aboout me to come as we go!

            There are no styles on this sheet so its ugly right now but it is Accessible. 
            I have a passion for web accessibility and do my best to make sure that anything I create is accessible to as many users possible. 
            A users level ability should not mean there is a barrier to the information they seek.
